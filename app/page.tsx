1.	From this list, rank your 5 most favourite and 5 least favourite support tasks. Provide a brief explanation for each.

	Top 5:
a) Create video tutorials to help teach users a specific feature or use case
-> This is one of my favorite tasks because I have done this for a long time in my current organization. I truly understand the value of such tutorials and what kind of impact they would have to both internal stakeholders and customers

b)	Find and recruit teammates for the support team

I love interacting with people and over the years I have learnt to understand and judge their strengths and weakness easily. I have been heavily involved in recruitment of engineers from Associates to Senior levels

c)	Act as a dedicated CSE for a handful of key customers to ensure their success using Vercel

I have worked as a primary support engineer for multiple premium customers. This involved weekly collaboration with IAT and in person meetings and trainings with the customer. I have received multiple spot awards for being the Best support engineer for these key accounts

d)	Scheduling time-off coverage and collaborating as part of a growing cohesive support team

As a lead engineer I have always been on top of managing staffing coverage for the team. Along with this, I have also helped in global support team coverage during public holidays across gets.

e)	Help train and onboard new support teammates

I started training the new joiners from the very next year I joined my current organization. I love putting everything together and explain with use cases and that has helped me to deliver best quality trainings

	Least 5:
a)	Help resolve billing issues for customers

One of the reasons this is not so favorite job, because these kinds of issues are usually associated with contract issues (from my experience) and they are a bit complicated to understand 

b)	Dig through logs to troubleshoot a customer's broken project

Can be a little time consuming if we do not have right tools to analyze and would require manual scripting 

c)	Run ticket review sessions to make sure tone is consistent
Might sound a little time consuming, would rather be interested if it is more of hot case discussion where we discuss corner case issues

d)	Write and maintain support articles and docs pages
I love to write articles and I have done that in the past too, but maintaining them is a little difficult if we do not have the right maintenance team

e)	Respond to queries on Twitter, Reddit, Hacker News and other 3rd party sites

Might be interesting but have not done that in the past. So, I can’t imagine what kind of queries would come on the social media


2.	What do you want to learn or do more of at work?

During my time at my current organization, I have learnt technical troubleshooting, customer management, people management, cross team collaboration  and more.

What I really want to learn is the new technology that Vercel offers. I have worked on basic web development during college and after that it has been mostly CDN support and Akamai specific products.

Vercel would help me learn the new frontend development tools and advanced technology that I have never been exposed to.
I would like to make use of my current experience and expertise to learn and contribute to Vercel in all possible ways.


3. Describe how you solved a challenge or technical issue that you faced in a previous role
(preferably in a previous support role). How did you determine that your solution was successful?

It was during my initial years of work at my current organization, I was asked to handle a very complex technical issue. It was escalated to C level executives on both the sides. 

What helped me succeed in that situation:
•	Thorough understanding of the issue and impact to the customer. This helped me calm down the customer as the impact was very minimal , but customer assumed that it was a high impact issue for them
•	Once we bought sometime from customer, we started working on the issue with collaboration from tier2 and engineering teams.
•	Regular and  transparent updates to customer helped us keep the situation at hand 
•	Once we identified the issue, it required changes at the customer end. It was very crucial to explain why their current set up did not work with our infrastructure. With the help of different documentation, RFCs we convinced them that , it indeed needed a change on their side.

Finally the changes were deployed on the customer side. I received a SPOT recognition for handling one of the toughest situation smoothly.
Customer was happy and content that the issue was identified and fixed which is a key success indicator  as a support engineer

4. When would you choose to use Edge Functions, Serverless Functions, or Edge
Middleware with Vercel?

I would choose Edge Functions when you need to execute code at the edge for optimizing content delivery or enforcing security policies. Choose Serverless Functions for general-purpose computational tasks that can benefit from scalability and cost-effectiveness. Use Edge Middleware for implementing cross-cutting concerns such as caching, routing, or security at the edge of the network.

5. Imagine a customer writes in requesting help with a build issue on a framework or technology that you've not seen before. How would you begin troubleshooting this and
what questions would you ask the customer to understand the situation better?

I think the first step would be to understand 
•	What is the error or issue they are facing during the build
•	My next questions would completely depend on the error / issue they are seeing 
•	Based on the information gathered, I would use the company documentation or articles associated with that error/issue 
•	Once I get initial understanding, I would do more research on that myself, and try to replicate the issue on my side.
•	If I do not find any documentation, I would discuss it with my peers or subordinates.

While we do all the technical analysis, I would keep the communication very clear with the customer and keep them updated on the progress and ensure timelines are met.

6. The customer from question 5 replies to your response with the below.
“I’m so frustrated. I’ve been trying to make this work for hours and I just can’t figure it
out. It must be a platform issue so just fix it for me instead of asking me questions.”
Please write a follow-up reply to the customer.
Hello Customer X, 

I understand that it is a frustrating situation for you because you have been trying for so long and it’s a time dependent task for you.
Please be assured that I am working on this with top priority. While I work to get this sorted for you , above requested information would help us to speed up the process and get us to resolution faster.
We could get on a live troubleshooting call if that works for you. I would also be able to present the analysis I have done on the issue so far.
Thank you for your patience and cooperation so far.

Regards
XXX

7. A customer writes in to the Helpdesk asking "How do I do a redirect from the /blog path to https://example.com?" Please write a reply to the customer. Feel free to add anyinformation about your decision making process after the reply.
We can set redirection at the server level with 301 or 302 response codes. This would have source URL and destination URL
301- Permanent redirect which will be cached in proxies and browsers 
302 - Temporary redirect which will not be cached anywhere

There is also a way we can set these redirects at the application level, using javascript , which I have not really worked on.

8. A customer is creating a site and would like their project not to be indexed by searchengines. Please write a reply to the customer. Feel free to add any information about your decision making process after the reply.

Hello Customer X, 

Thank you for writing to us. 
To achieve this, we can implement a few measures to instruct search engines not to index your site.

•	We can create a "robots.txt" file in the root directory of your website and include directives to disallow all search engine crawlers from accessing your site. 
•	Using "meta" tags within your HTML code to tell search engine bots not to index specific pages or the entire site. 
•	Additionally, we can implement password protection for your website using authentication methods. 
If you would like to proceed with any of these measures please feel free to let us know, and we'll be happy to assist you further.

9. What do you think is one of the most common problems which customers ask Vercel for help with? How would you help customers to overcome common problems, short-term and long-term?

Since Vercel is centered around deploying and hosting websites and web applications, most commonly reported issues would be 

•	Build and deployment issues
•	Performance issues
•	Monitoring 
•	Requesting information around logs 


10. How could we improve or alter this familiarisation exercise?
Some of real time scenarios of verbal support team would help us familiarize better
